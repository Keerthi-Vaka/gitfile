    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p> Using equipment that a high school student could only dream of using, I was able to map apoptosis (programmed
        cell death) versus necrosis (cell death due to damage) in HeLa cells, a cervical cancer line, after treating
        them with curcumin-bound nanoparticles. Using flow cytometry to excite each individually suspended cell with a
        laser, the scattered light from the cells helped to determine which cells were living, had died from apoptosis
        or had died from necrosis. Using this collected data, it was possible to determine if the curcumin and/or the
        nanoparticles had played any significant role on the cervical cancer cells. Later, I was able to image cells in
        4D through con-focal microscopy
